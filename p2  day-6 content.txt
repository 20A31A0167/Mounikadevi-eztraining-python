graph is a combination of vertices and edges
types of graph:
1.undireected graph
2.directed graph
3.weight  graph
#representation of graph
1.list of edges
2.adjacency of list
3.adjacency of matrix

#bfs:in bredth for search visit a vertex and visit all the adjacent vetices
#dfs:in this after visiting a vertex select one of its adjacent and explore with completely move on with other vertex.

dikshtra algorithm:
it comes under 3d where solution for the given oroblrm id figyred out stage by stage.
helps you to find out shortest path/distance from one vertex to all the other vertices
drawback:if weihght of any edge is negative number dikshtra work for that.
